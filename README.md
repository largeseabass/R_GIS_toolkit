I will share some useful r functions here for GIS tasks.

## Raster PCA designed for large rasters made for Caret Package User

I didn't see any functions available online for performing PCA on rasters with PCA-model trained with Caret Package, and no functions designed for large raster (which gives memory limit error). I made these functions. Hope you will find it useful as well.
